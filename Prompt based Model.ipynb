"\n\nGDP stands for Gross Domestic Product and is an economic measure of a country's total economic output. It is a measure of the value of all goods and services produced within a country's borders in a given period of time, typically a year. It includes consumer spending, government spending, investments, and exports minus imports. This measure is important because it can be used to compare the economic performance of different countries and to assess the overall health of an economy."
